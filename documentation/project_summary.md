## Demand Forecasting & SKU Behavior Analysis – Summary

This project focuses on understanding retail demand patterns and forecasting behavior using historical sales data. SQL was used to clean and transform transactional data, calculate monthly demand, and classify SKUs based on demand consistency.

Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes demand trends, SKU movement distribution, and compares actual sales against a 3-month moving average forecast.

The analysis helps identify demand volatility, highlights inventory risks associated with slow-moving products, and provides a foundation for improving forecasting accuracy in retail environments.
